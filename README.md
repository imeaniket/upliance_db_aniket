to explore the interplay between cooking sessions and user orders, identify the most popular dishes, and examine how demographic factors influence user behavior. By integrating, cleaning, and analyzing this data, the study aims to uncover trends and patterns that can inform strategic business decisions.

Problem Statement & Approach 
To have a better understanding of user behavior and preferences for crucial business decisions aiming to optimize our offerings and enhance customer satisfaction.
Here in this project , our objective is to provide meaningful contributions to the understanding of user behavior in the context of cooking and ordering, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making for improved customer engagement and operational efficiency. Some of these included :
Average preparation time duration for different Meals
Demographic distribution for total orders
Count of Meal preferences & Order placed
User Wise Amount Spent
Average Session rating V/S Meal Type

Tool Introduction : The primary tool used for data analysis here is Spreadsheets because of its features for creating charts, graphs, and pivot tables, enabling for quicker visualization of trends and patterns. In addition, it is best suitable for small datasets and handling a wide range of tasks.


1). Time Duration for Dishes
The time duration for all the aggregated dishes collectively counted is 30 mins.
Grilled Chicken came out to be the dish consuming the highest time at almost 42 mins, which might be a way too long waiting time for consumers as it is evident in another insight, where, out of the two orders canceled, one of them was Grilled Chicken.
In addition, Oatmeal took the least time at 10 mins. However, it was also a meal with least Session rating at 4.1
Here, it's important for us that the overall taste & quality of Dish should not be compromised as it will eventually compensate for wait time, & not affect the customer experience & ratings.
The reason for orders getting cancelled also need to be tracked.

2). Count of Favourite Meals & Orders Placed
Here is an interesting insight as More people had their favourite meal as Lunch as compared to Breakfast, but still the order placed in breakfast was more in comparison to lunch.
Basic understanding tells us most of the consumers are working professionals , as they need quickly made breakfast. After preparing breakfast, they are not able to wait another 30 mins for lunch preparation & ultimately they skip the process. 
In addition, here we can introduce ‘brunch’ type of meals, or heavier meals. 
Another option would be to introduce 2 different jars working at the same time (just like using 2 burners of a stove) to reduce time significantly. However, we will first need to understand consumer perception before introducing a major product feature.   

3). User Wise Meal-Type Order Placed
Here we find out that only 35% of our consumers have used our product at least thrice, in past 9 days
Only 2 users have attempted to use all 3 meal types , of which only one user completed the orders, whereas another user (user3) actually cancelled two meals.
Frequency of footfall for consumers is still low, they are still not completely relying on our product as a complete Cooking assistant to completely replace manual cooking.

4). Region Wise Distribution
After analysing region wise sales, we can deduce that it's important, we scale and promote ourselves more as an Urban Phenomenon, where our biggest target audience is working single professionals.
What that means is, to project ourselves to people who have moved out of their home towns to other cities (in this case T1++ cities), where they are unable to find manual home assistants, they end up relying on Upliance.
This will not only help us filter out a good section of potential consumers and go with fully aggressive and high yielding strategies on those people only, saving time and resources both.
This can also include cities which are already or are on verge of seeing an economic boom or transformation.  

5). Session Rating vs Meal Type
Evidently, here the average rating is 4.5
On a closer look we find out that the session rating is average minimum for Breakfast , even though the least tryouts are in the morning (only 3), because when people are in a rush, they cannot afford extra time usage by Upliance, resulting in lower ratings.
Also, they feel free to use Upliance at night for dinner , and even time consumption does not bother them.
Thats why, even with more uses, the average rating is still highest for Dinner.
Since session rating is more dependent on the preparation process, we should include items for Breakfast offerings with minimal instruction/asking steps on the touch screen and also minimal effort and ingredient based dishes.
